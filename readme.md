## The folder can be installed into an Integrify instance and configured to allow SSO integration via SAML 2.0

### To configure:

* Download and unzip this folder. Save it under webserver/app/_custom in your Integrify installation.
* from a command prompt in this folder run the command "npm install"
* Obtain a certificate in base64 format if required to verify the SAML asertion sent from your IDP and copy it to this folder
* Copy the config.saml.js, config-adfs.js or config-openid.js (example configs) file to a file named config.js in this folder
* Edit config.js based on the requirements specified by your IDP and your Integrify instance settings. Note, you will need a Consumer_Key with API access with Impersonation enabled. See your OAUTH_CONSUMERS table.
* Copy the samlauth.yml file to  /webserver/app/data/routes
* Copy the auth-config-yourhost-yourport.yml file to the root /webserver. Edit the contents of this file and replace myapikey in the iurl property to a valid API key for your instance.
Rename the file replacing yourhost with the host name of the Integrify server. If running on a port other than 80 or 443, replace -yourport with the port the Integrify servier is listening on. 
If Integrify is running on port 80 or por 443, remove the -yourport section from the file name.
* restart your Integrify isntance
* browse to http(s)://{integrify server}/samlauth/{app_key}/status to verify that the module has loaded
* browse to http(s)://{integrify server}/samlauth/{app_key}/metadata to get the XML metadata that describes this service including the Assertion Consumer Service URL and Identifier


### Mapping your SAML Attributes to Integrify profile fields:

Locate the section of your config.js file for teh fieldMap. It will look something like this by default:

    "fieldMap": {
                "NameFirst": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname",
                "NameLast": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/CommonName",
                "Email": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress",
                "UserName": "nameID",
                "Title": "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role",
                "Defaults":{"TimeZone":"Eastern Standard Time"}
                }
            
            
This shows the minimum set of fields required for an Integrify profile. The Integrify Profile field name is the key and the value should match the 
corresponding attribute name in your SAML assertion.

Here is a full list of available profile fields than may be mapped:

     "fieldMap": {
                  
                    "NetworkID": "yourSamlAttribute...",          
                    "UserName": "yourSamlAttribute...",               
                    "Email": "yourSamlAttribute...",        
                    "NameFirst" : "yourSamlAttribute...",              
                    "NameLast": "yourSamlAttribute...",                
                    "NameMiddle": "yourSamlAttribute...",               
                    "AddressLine1": "yourSamlAttribute...",

                    "Phone": "yourSamlAttribute...",                      
                    "Title": "yourSamlAttribute...",              
                    "Custom1": "yourSamlAttribute...", 
                    "Custom1": "yourSamlAttribute...", 

                    
    
                }
                
A user that has never been logged in will have their profile created automatically. Returning users will have their profile updated based on the information passed.
